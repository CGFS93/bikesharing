# Bikesharing


## Overview of the Analysis:

 Analysis of New York Citi Bike data from August 2019, using data visualization with Tableau to explore the viability of a bike-sharing business in Des Moines.


### Purpose:

The purpose of the current analysis is to prepare visualizations that give potential investors a look into the highly-successful NYC Citibike bike-sharing program, so that they can see for themselves that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal. Among others, we have prepared visualizations that 1) Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders, 2) Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week, and 3) Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.

- There were over 2.3 million rides for the month of August 2019.
- 81% of the users were subscribers. 65% of the users were confirmed males and 25% were confirmed females.
- There is a wide range of the age of the users. Younger users tend to use the service for longer rides.
- Top ride starting locations are in the most touristic and busy areas, as we see here in Manhattan.

- Highest activity hours are from 5:00 PM to 7:00 PM and require the most resources mobilized.
- The activity from 2:00 AM to 5:00 AM is low so this would be the window for bike maintenance.

- Most weekday rides are around 7:00 AM to 9 AM and 5:00 PM to 7:00 PM.
- Weekend rides are highest from 10:00 AM to 7:00 PM.
- Those rides are mostly taken by male users.

## Summary:

The data shows high activity of the bike sharing service in New York during the month of August 2019.\
The far majority of the rides were in the very busy Manhattan Island, taken by male users during morning and evening rush hours. This implies that Citi Bike services are used as an alternative to public transportation by commuting workers.\
Additional analysis would be beneficial by :
- comparing data for different months to determine trends across the year,
- including weather data to find the correlation between the weather and the rides.
